# How to contribute

Please read this page *[Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)* to help you to fork this repository.

Contribution to this repository is always done through Pull Requests
(PR).

## Golden rules for a good Pull Request
1. Never implement your feature/bug fix in the `master` branch!
   Instead, create a new branch with an explicit name *(`fix-...`,
   `feature-...`, etc.)* :

    ```
    git checkout -b your-branch-name upstream/master
    ```

2. Your code, comments, commit message and pull request description
   must be in English.
3. Explain why you are proposing this pull request in a few lines.
4. Prefer many small pull request over large ones.
4. For my students: Indicate your team in your pull request.
